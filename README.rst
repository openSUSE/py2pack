Py2pack: Generate distribution packages from PyPI
=================================================

This script allows to generate RPM spec or DEB dsc files from Python modules.
It allows to list Python modules or search for them on the Python Package Index
(PyPI). Conveniently, it can fetch tarballs and changelogs making it an
universal tool to package Python modules.


Installation
------------

To install py2pack from the `Python Package Index`_, simply:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 -mpip install py2pack

You can also check your distro of choice if they provide packages.
For openSUSE Tumbleweed and Leap 15.X, you can

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo zypper install python3-py2pack


Usage
-----

Lets suppose you want to package zope.interface_ and you don't know how it is named
exactly. First of all, you can search for it and download the source tarball if
you found the correct module:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ py2pack search zope.interface
    searching for module zope.interface...
    found zope.interface-3.6.1
    $ py2pack fetch zope.interface
    downloading package zope.interface-3.6.1...
    from http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/z/zope.interface/zope.interface-3.6.1.tar.gz


As a next step you may want to generate a package recipe for your distribution.
For RPM_-based distributions (let's use openSUSE_ as an example), you want to
generate a spec file (named 'python-zope.interface.spec'):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ py2pack generate zope.interface -t opensuse.spec -f python-zope.interface.spec

The source tarball and the package recipe is all you need to generate the RPM_
(or DEB_) file.
This final step may depend on which distribution you use. Again,
for openSUSE_ (and by using the `Open Build Service`_), the complete recipe is:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ osc mkpac python-zope.interface
    $ cd python-zope.interface
    $ py2pack fetch zope.interface
    $ py2pack generate zope.interface -f python-zope.interface.spec
    $ osc build
    ...

Depending on the module, you may have to adapt the resulting spec file slightly.
To get further help about py2pack usage, issue the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ py2pack help


Hacking and contributing
------------------------

You can test py2pack from your git checkout by executing the py2pack module:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 -m py2pack

Fork `the repository`_ on Github to start making your changes to the **master**
branch (or branch off of it). Don't forget to write a test for fixed issues or
implemented features whenever appropriate. You can invoke the testsuite from
the repository root directory via `tox`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tox

To run a single test class via `tox`_, use i.e.:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tox -epy38 test.test_py2pack:Py2packTestCase


You can also run `pytest`_ directly:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pytest

It assumes you have the test dependencies installed (available on PYTHONPATH)
on your system.
